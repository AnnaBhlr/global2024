      NeuroDesk was a project proposed at the 2020 Australian chapter of the OHBM hackathon,
      which has grown into a fully-fledged data analysis environment and is powering the
      Australian Electrophysiology Data Analytics PlaTform (AEDAPT) project funded by
      the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).
